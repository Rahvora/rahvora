    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Rhavora was born out of a simple idea: that the products we use every day should make life better — not just for us, but for the world we share. 
      We saw a gap between what people needed and what was being offered — so we decided to listen. Really listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team began by speaking with real people, exploring the rhythms of daily life, and uncovering unmet needs. 
      From there, we started building solutions — smart, sustainable products designed with care, created with integrity, and delivered with purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Rhavora, we don’t follow trends. We follow people. And by doing so, we create things that matter.
